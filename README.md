# MTBOT

Verrrry Expermimental

Read MTCLIENT class docstring

## How to use

You need srp:  
pip3 install srp

Important: As this is a srp module which is not really compatible with mt-srp  
Only registration-login(first_srp) works

## TODO

- Fix SRP (currently only first_srp is working as any data is accepted)
- Some thread-safe testing
- Split packages


Help is welcome!
